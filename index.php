			<h1>Kirsten Ullrich, Project 1</h1>
			<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a distance student originally from Louisville, Kentucky who has lived in a good handful of places before landing in Brattleboro, Vermont with husband and cat five years ago. I earn my living doing graphic design, mostly for print, but increasing demand for web design has led me to explore 'the other side.' What I've learned thus far about web design and coding is a flea market-worthy hodgepodge of things that derive from using Dreamweaver, watching videos on lynda.com and treehouse.com, and (most informatively) from tackling projects that were bigger than my knowledge base at the time. As a result, I have a hard-earned working knowledge of web design that has plenty of gaps. And I also discovered that I really enjoy the process and challenge of figuring out a code problem and making it work. Who knew?.

			<h2>Turkey Umber</h2>
				<p>
The part of my life that isn't devoted to making a living is devoted to making art. I got my MFA from the Tyler School of Art in 2005; I'm a painter and sculptor. While I use nearly any material I can get my hands on, I have an enduring love of oil paint, in part because of its incredible variety of very specific colors with long histories. One of those colors is turkey umber; the pigment is great, but I love it just as much for having a name that evokes Istanbul and a big, goofy bird at the same time. And, yes, I actually do use quite a bit of it. Here's what turkey umber looks like:
